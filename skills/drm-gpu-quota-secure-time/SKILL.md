name: drm-gpu-quota-secure-time
description: GPU resource-lockout design (per-cgroup VRAM quota + hard enforcement via secure world) and ARM64 secure-time sourcing for OP-TEE on Rockchip (CFG_SECURE_TIME_SOURCE_CNTPCT). Covers the real upstream DRM device-memory cgroup effort ("dev" controller, not the old "drmcg" RFC), the real Panfrost BO-allocation hook points (panfrost_ioctl_create_bo, panfrost_lookup_bos), a from-scratch SMC-mailbox lockout pattern for boards without a merged cgroup controller, and OP-TEE's CNTPCT-based secure clock on RK3399/RK3588. Explicitly flags which APIs from casual research/chat notes are real upstream kernel symbols versus invented/outdated ones, so implementation doesn't cargo-cult a hallucinated function name. Use when designing GPU memory quotas, per-cgroup GPU lockout, Panfrost/Mali resource limits, or when wiring OP-TEE's secure time source on Rockchip SoCs. (see SKILL.md body for full trigger list)

# GPU quota/lockout + ARM64 secure time (grounded corrections)

## Why this skill exists

Source material for this area (two ChatGPT research threads) mixed real
kernel/OP-TEE APIs with plausible-sounding but non-existent ones. This skill
is the corrected, source-checked version. **Don't copy function names
straight out of an LLM chat transcript for this subsystem — verify against
`elixir.bootlin.com` or the actual repo first.**

## 1. DRM device-memory cgroup: real upstream state (mid-2026)

There is **no merged "drmcg" controller** and **no `drmcg_try_charge()` /
`drmcg_uncharge()` kernel functions** — those names came from 2021–2023 RFC
threads (`drmcg`, exposing `drm.max`/`memory.max`) that were abandoned in
favor of a redesign. Do not build against those symbols; they don't exist in
any shipped kernel.

The live effort is the **generic `dev` cgroup controller** (aka `devcg`,
distinct from the old device-*access* `devices` controller):
- Patchset: `kernel/cgroup: Add "dev" memory accounting cgroup`
  (dri-devel list, most recently revised late 2024/2025; a parallel
  DRM-scheduling-cgroup RFC v8 from Tvrtko Ursulin, Sept 2025, is also still
  in flight). **Not in mainline as of this writing** — treat as a moving
  target, re-check `lore.kernel.org/dri-devel` before depending on exact
  field names.
- Interface shape (subject to change pre-merge): `dev.region.max`,
  `dev.region.current`, `dev.region.capacity` — nested-keyed files under
  `/sys/fs/cgroup/`, keyed by a device+region string (e.g.
  `drm/0000:03:00.0 vram0=...`), not a flat `dev.memory.max`.

**Implication for yubiOS/Rockchip (Panfrost, no discrete VRAM region):** even
once `dev` lands, it's aimed at drivers with distinct memory regions
(TTM-based: Xe, AMDGPU). Panfrost's GEM/shmem model doesn't yet have a wired
region, so don't block a v0 design on this controller landing or applying
cleanly — build your own accounting hook now (§3) and plan to swap to the
upstream controller later if/when Panfrost gets a `dev` region.

## 2. Real Panfrost hook points (verified against panfrost_drv.c)

These two are real, current, and exactly where per-allocation accounting
belongs:

- `panfrost_ioctl_create_bo(struct drm_device *dev, void *data, struct drm_file *file)`
  — `DRM_IOCTL_PANFROST_CREATE_BO` handler in
  `drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_drv.c`. Reads `struct
  drm_panfrost_create_bo` (has `.size`), calls `panfrost_gem_create()`,
  installs a GEM handle. **This is the allocation-time hook** — charge quota
  here, before the shmem object is created, and fail with `-ENOMEM` /
  `-EDQUOT` before calling into `panfrost_gem_create()` if over limit.
- `panfrost_lookup_bos(struct drm_device *dev, struct drm_file *file_priv, struct drm_panfrost_submit *args, struct panfrost_job *job)`
  — resolves submit-time handles to GEM objects, bumps refcounts. Second
  guard point: reject submission from an already-over-quota context even if
  the BOs were allocated earlier (closes the "allocate under limit, blow
  past it via reuse" gap).

Free-path accounting belongs in the GEM object's `.free` callback
(`panfrost_gem_free_object` in `panfrost_gem.c`) — uncharge there, keyed off
the same identity used at charge time.

## 3. Cgroup identity: use current, real APIs, not invented ones

The chat-derived skeletons used `task_cgroup(current, 0)` and a bare
`get_cgroup(cg)` — these are **not the current cgroup v2 kernel API**
surface. Before writing real code, verify against the exact kernel version
you're targeting (`elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v<X>/A/ident/<symbol>`) — cgroup
internals move. As of recent kernels the idiomatic pattern for cgroup v2
default-hierarchy membership is via `task_css_set()` / `task_dfl_cgrp()` /
`cgroup_id()`, with `cgroup_get()`/`cgroup_put()` for refcounting — but
**confirm the exact names for your target kernel major version before
committing to a design**; don't trust either this skill or an LLM chat log
as the final source, check `include/linux/cgroup.h` in the actual tree
you're building against.

Practical accounting shape (identity-agnostic, safe to build now):
```c
struct gpu_cg_quota {
    u64 id;            /* cgroup_id(), stable identifier */
    u64 vram_used;
    u64 vram_limit;
    struct list_head node;
};
```
Key your accounting table off `cgroup_id()` (a stable u64), not off the
`struct cgroup *` pointer — avoids holding a reference you have to manage
across the lifetime of every tracked allocation.

## 4. SMC-based hard lockout: this is a custom mechanism, not upstream

Everything past "kernel accounts, then asks for a hard cutoff" in the source
material (`GPU_LOCKOUT_SMC` function ID, the `gpu_lockout_msg` mailbox
struct, secure-monitor-side enforcement) is a **from-scratch design**, not an
existing kernel/TF-A/OP-TEE facility. Treat it as a proposal, not a citation.
Two corrections before implementing:

- **SMC function IDs are not arbitrary.** The ARM SMC Calling Convention
  reserves ranges by owning entity (Arch, CPU service, SiP service, OEM
  service, Standard service, Trusted OS, Trusted Application). A yubiOS-owned
  hard-lockout call belongs in the **SiP Service range**
  (`0xC2000000`–`0xC200FFFF` for fast calls, per the SMCCC spec) and needs to
  be wired into TF-A's own SMC dispatch table (`plat_spm_helpers.c` / the
  runtime services dispatcher) or into a custom SP if using an FF-A/SPMD
  setup — it doesn't reach OP-TEE or the secure monitor just by being called;
  something in TF-A/BL31 has to claim that ID first. Verify the exact
  reserved sub-ranges in the current SMCCC spec before allocating a real ID.
- **Enforcement still has to bottom out in a real primitive.** "Revoke IOMMU
  mappings" / "fence GPU context" / "reset GPU" are Linux DRM/IOMMU-API
  operations (`drm_sched_stop()`-family fencing, IOMMU domain
  detach/invalidate, driver-specific reset), not something a secure monitor
  can do to a normal-world GPU driver's live state without cooperation. The
  realistic v0 architecture is: **Linux enforces (deny/kill/reset), the SMC
  path is only useful for cutting power/clocks at a level Linux can't be
  trusted to self-police** (e.g. compromised-userspace scenarios). Don't
  build the SMC mailbox before the Linux-side accounting+enforcement is
  working and proven necessary — it's the second escalation tier, not the
  first thing to ship.

Recommended v0 scope, in order: (1) Panfrost BO create/submit accounting per
cgroup-id with soft/hard in-kernel limits (deny allocation, deny submit) —
ships value with zero firmware changes; (2) only if self-policing normal
world is insufficient for the threat model, design the SiP SMC + TF-A
dispatch as a second PR with its own ADR.

## 5. OP-TEE secure time source on RK3399/RK3588 — verified

`CFG_SECURE_TIME_SOURCE_CNTPCT` is real and confirmed forced-on for the
Rockchip platform port:

```
# core/arch/arm/plat-rockchip/conf.mk (OP-TEE/optee_os)
$(call force,CFG_SECURE_TIME_SOURCE_CNTPCT,y)
```

This applies to every Rockchip `PLATFORM_FLAVOR` built against
`plat-rockchip`, which covers both RK3399 and RK3588 — there's no
board-specific override needed; it's inherited from the shared Rockchip
platform config.

What it does: `TEE_GetSystemTime()` / `tee_time_get_sys_time()` resolve time
from the ARM generic timer's physical counter (`CNTPCT_EL0`), read from
secure world, instead of trusting the normal-world (REE) wall clock. This
raises `gpd.tee.systemTime.protectionLevel` to `1000` (TEE-controlled secure
clock) rather than the REE-trusting default. There is **no separate
RK3399/RK3588 TrustZone-only clock peripheral** — it's the same architectural
generic timer counter, just read with secure privilege (`PL0PCTEN`/secure
timer access controls apply) instead of being handed REE's idea of time.

Relevance to yubiOS: this is directly useful for anything that needs
tamper-resistant timestamps ahead of a real RTC/attestation service (e.g.
bounding replay windows for fTPM NV counters, or timestamping the ADR-018/019
ARM64 fTPM measured-boot event log with a time value normal-world userspace
can't roll back). Pairs with `ftpm-optee-tpm` and
`arm-trusted-firmware-optee` — check those before assuming this is a
standalone feature; it's a config bit inside the same OP-TEE build those
skills already cover.

## Sources to re-check before implementing

- `lore.kernel.org/dri-devel` — search "dev cgroup" / "DRM scheduling cgroup"
  for current patchset state; do not assume the interface names above are
  final.
- `elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_drv.c`
  — confirm hook signatures against the kernel version yubiOS actually ships.
- `github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/core/arch/arm/plat-rockchip/conf.mk`
  — confirm the force-on still holds for the OP-TEE version pinned in the
  firmware stack.
- ARM SMCCC spec (`developer.arm.com`, "SMC Calling Convention") — confirm
  the SiP range before allocating a real function ID.
