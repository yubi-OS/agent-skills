Covers building the fTPM TA, the Early-TA vs dynamic-TA decision, RPMB-backed NV storage, the RPMB-before-supplicant bootstrap hazard, the U-Boot tpm2_ftpm_tee driver, the Linux tpm_ftpm_tee driver, measured-boot event log handoff, IMA probe ordering, and how the fTPM (platform integrity) stays complementary to the YubiKey (user identity / disk unlock). Use when building or debugging the fTPM TA, wiring it to U-Boot or Linux, or deciding the fTPM-vs-YubiKey split. Pairs with `arm-trusted-firmware-optee` for the TF-A/OP-TEE/U-Boot firmware stack.

# fTPM on OP-TEE (ms-tpm-20-ref) for yubiOS

## When to use

The post-launch ARM64 project ([FUTURE.md](https://github.com/yubi-OS/yubiOS/blob/main/FUTURE.md))
gives yubiOS a TPM 2.0 it **owns** on ARM64 hardware that has no discrete TPM.
This skill covers the TPM itself (the OP-TEE Trusted Application). The firmware
stack that hosts it (TF-A, OP-TEE OS, U-Boot) is the sibling skill
`arm-trusted-firmware-optee`.

Why this matters for a FIDO2-first OS: measured boot needs a TPM-shaped thing to
hold PCRs and seal secrets. On ARM64 the vendor's fTPM (if any) is a trust anchor
yubiOS did not choose. Running our own `ms-tpm-20-ref` in our own OP-TEE build
makes the PCR set and sealing root **ours**, auditable, and reproducible.

## What it is

- **`OP-TEE/optee_ftpm`** — the canonical integration repo (split out of
  `ms-tpm-20-ref`'s `Historical_Samples/Samples/ARM32-FirmwareTPM` in Oct 2024).
  This is the maintained home; the in-tree MS sample is historical.
- Wraps **`microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref`** (a full TPM 2.0 reference). Pin to commit
  **`98b60a44aba79b15fcce1c0d1e46cf5918400f6a`** (the commit optee_ftpm expects).
- fTPM TA **UUID: `bc50d971-d4c9-42c4-82cb-343fb7f37896`**.
- Used in production on NVIDIA BlueField DPUs — that BSP doc is the best worked
  example of the whole flow.

## Building the TA

```sh
# 1. Check out the pinned ms-tpm-20-ref
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref
git -C ms-tpm-20-ref checkout 98b60a44aba79b15fcce1c0d1e46cf5918400f6a

# 2. Build the fTPM TA against the OP-TEE TA dev kit
make -C optee_ftpm \
  TA_DEV_KIT_DIR=<optee_os>/out/<plat>/export-ta_arm64 \
  CFG_MS_TPM_20_REF=<abs-path>/ms-tpm-20-ref \
  CFG_TA_MEASURED_BOOT=y \
  CFG_TA_EVENT_LOG_SIZE=4096
```

- `CFG_MS_TPM_20_REF` must point at the checked-out reference source.
- `CFG_TA_MEASURED_BOOT=y` enables reading + extending a TCG2 event log at TA
  init. Requires the OP-TEE PTA `PTA_SYSTEM_GET_TPM_EVENT_LOG`.
- `CFG_TA_EVENT_LOG_SIZE` defaults to 1024 bytes — too small for a real chain;
  bump it (e.g. 4096+).
- Output is `bc50d971-d4c9-42c4-82cb-343fb7f37896.{elf,ta,stripped.elf}`.

## Early TA vs dynamic TA — pick Early TA

A **dynamic TA** loads from the rootfs (`/lib/optee_armtz/<uuid>.ta`) after the
filesystem is mounted and `tee-supplicant` is running. But U-Boot and Linux IMA
both need the TPM **before** any rootfs exists. So build the fTPM as an
**Early TA**, compiled into the OP-TEE binary's `.rodata.early_ta` section:

```sh
make -C optee_os \
  PLATFORM=<plat> \
  CFG_RPMB_FS=y \
  CFG_EARLY_TA=y \
  EARLY_TA_PATHS="<path>/bc50d971-d4c9-42c4-82cb-343fb7f37896.stripped.elf"
```

Now the fTPM is alive the instant OP-TEE boots, with no userspace dependency.

## The bootstrap hazard (read before you build hardware)

The fTPM needs persistent NV storage (seeds, monotonic counters, NV indices)
in **RPMB**. But an Early TA initializes **before `tee-supplicant`** is running,
and OP-TEE's normal RPMB path RPCs out to that supplicant. An early NV write with
no supplicant **panics** (OP-TEE issue #5766). Two mitigations:

1. Run `tee-supplicant` from the **initramfs** so it is up before Linux needs the
   TPM, and defer the fTPM's first persistent write until then; **and/or**
2. Use an early in-OP-TEE RPMB path (platform-dependent) so the secure world can
   reach eMMC without the normal-world supplicant.

This is the single biggest integration risk. Prove it on emulation (QEMU virt)
in Phase F0 before touching real hardware.

## U-Boot side

Driver `tpm2_ftpm_tee.c`. Kconfig + DT node are in `arm-trusted-firmware-optee`.
Summary: `CONFIG_TPM2_FTPM_TEE=y`, DT `tpm { compatible = "microsoft,ftpm"; };`,
then `tpm2 init` / `tpm2 startup`, replay firmware event log into PCRs, measure
kernel/DTB/initramfs, hand log to Linux via `linux,sml-base` / `linux,sml-size`.

## Linux side

```
CONFIG_TEE=y
CONFIG_OPTEE=y
CONFIG_TCG_TPM=y
CONFIG_TCG_FTPM_TEE=m     # drivers/char/tpm/tpm_ftpm_tee.c (Microsoft)
```

- `tpm_ftpm_tee.ko` reads `linux,sml-base` / `-size` from the DTB, exposes
  `/dev/tpm0` and `/dev/tpmrm0`.
- **Probe ordering**: the fTPM must be registered before IMA runs, and the OP-TEE
  bus needs RPMB access (so `tee-supplicant` in initramfs). If IMA runs first you
  get probe deferral / missing measurements. Use early init tables for the probe.

## PCR layout (convention)

| PCR | Content |
|---|---|
| 0, 1 | System firmware (BL31/BL32/BL33) + config |
| 2, 3 | Option ROM / drivers (rarely used on ARM SoC) |
| 7 | Secure Boot policy state |
| 8, 9 | Kernel, DTB, initramfs (measured by U-Boot) |
| 10 | IMA runtime measurement log |

Seal to PCR 0/1/7 for "is this the firmware+policy we signed".

## fTPM vs YubiKey — keep them complementary

| | fTPM (in OP-TEE) | YubiKey 5 |
|---|---|---|
| Job | Platform integrity, PCR measurement, attestation, optional seal | User identity, secret unlock, signing |
| Location | On-device, secure world | External hardware, off-device |
| yubiOS use | Measured boot + attestation root on ARM64; bind `ConditionSecurity=measured-os` | Primary RoT, unchanged — FIDO2 hmac-secret unlocks LUKS2 (ADR-003) |

**Rule:** the YubiKey stays the disk-unlock path. The fTPM seal, if used, is an
additive attestation/fallback bound to PCRs — never the sole gate. If the fTPM
becomes the only unlock, yubiOS has reintroduced exactly the on-device,
vendor-shaped trust anchor it exists to remove.

## Pinning & supply chain

The fTPM is software — a `ms-tpm-20-ref` or OP-TEE bug is a TPM bug. Pin
optee_ftpm, ms-tpm-20-ref (`98b60a44`), OP-TEE OS, and TF-A commits; fold into
the existing Renovate digest tracking (ADR-015) and the Docker Buildx + OPA/Rego
pipeline (ADR-014). Track upstream ms-tpm-20-ref CVEs; do not fork-and-forget.
