# PR Launch

Turns a project into a story that travels. Works for technical open-source launches where you need to reach two audiences at once: engineers who will read the code, and general users who need to understand why it matters.

## When to Use

- Preparing a first public launch of an open-source project
- Announcing a major release or pivot
- Seeding community channels before broader press
- Drafting bifurcated messaging for technical and general audiences

## Project Context: yubios

The current active project is **yubios** — a TPM-free, OEM-friendly bootable Linux OS that uses the YubiKey as the sole root of trust across the full stack: Secure Boot signing, disk encryption (LUKS via FIDO2), application auth (PAM-U2F), SSH (resident ed25519-sk keys), and user onboarding.

Repo: https://github.com/corning-croak-cable/yubios

**Lead angle:** YubiKey as the only root of trust, full stack — no TPM required.

**Audiences:**
1. **Technical** — Linux engineers, security researchers, homelab operators, corporate Linux admins. Channels: HN, LWN.net, r/linux, r/netsec, r/linuxhardware, Phoronix, The Register, Lobste.rs
2. **General** — Privacy-conscious users tired of vendor lock-in, people who own YubiKeys and don't know this is possible, hardware enthusiasts. Channels: r/privacy, r/hardware, broader tech press (Ars Technica, Wired), product-focused newsletters

## Launch Phases

### Phase 0: Pre-Launch Prep (2-3 days before)

1. **README audit** — ensure it answers the 4 questions every first-time reader has:
   - What does this do?
   - Why does this exist (and why not TPM)?
   - How do I try it in 5 minutes?
   - How do I trust this?
   
2. **Asset creation** (see templates below):
   - HN Show HN post (technical, link to repo)
   - Reddit seed post for r/netsec and r/linux (technical)
   - Reddit seed post for r/privacy (general)
   - 1-paragraph press pitch (Phoronix, LWN, Ars Technica)
   - 3-tweet/post thread (social summary)

3. **Seeding** — privately brief 2-3 trusted community members who can comment early on the HN post. Organic early upvotes change trajectory.

### Phase 1: Launch Day (T=0)

Sequence matters. HN is the kingmaker for technical launches. Hit it first, then fan out within 2 hours.

1. HN "Show HN" post (9–11 AM ET on a weekday — Thursday ideal)
2. Lobste.rs submit
3. r/netsec and r/linux simultaneously
4. Email pitch to Phoronix, LWN, The Register
5. r/privacy and broader community channels

Do NOT cross-post to Reddit subreddits within the same hour — spacing 30-60 minutes avoids spam flags.

### Phase 2: Press Follow-up (Days 2-5)

- Follow up on unanswered press pitches
- Engage every HN and Reddit comment within 24 hours — this is the highest-leverage window
- Capture coverage links in `documents/pr/coverage.md`

### Phase 3: Sustained Momentum (Week 2+)

- Write a technical deep-dive post (LWN guest post, own blog, or GitHub Discussion)
- Post to FIDO Alliance community forums
- Submit to relevant newsletter roundups (TLDR, Console, The Changelog)

## Message Frameworks

### Technical Audience (engineers, security researchers)

**Headline:** "Show HN: yubios — bootable Linux with YubiKey as the only root of trust (no TPM)"

**Core message:** YubiKeys are ubiquitous in enterprise security. They support FIDO2/U2F, PIV/CCID, and resident keys — yet most Linux distributions still build their security model around TPM, which is OEM-controlled, opaque, and often absent on ARM hardware. yubios wires the YubiKey into every security-critical moment: Secure Boot key custody (PIV), disk unlock (FIDO2 via `systemd-cryptenroll`), app auth (pam-u2f ≥1.3.1), and SSH (resident ed25519-sk). The result is a reproducible, auditable, hardware-enforced trust chain with zero OEM dependency.

**Supporting points:**
- TPM-free = works on any hardware including Surface Snapdragon ARM64
- Every decision has a source citation or ADR — no hand-waving
- pam-u2f pinned to ≥1.3.1 due to CVE-2025-23013 (YSA-2025-01)
- Onboarding walks you from zero to resident SSH keys in <10 minutes

**Avoid:** "revolutionary," "game-changing," anything that sounds like marketing

### General Audience (privacy-conscious users, YubiKey owners)

**Headline:** "This bootable Linux uses your YubiKey for everything — boot, encryption, login, SSH"

**Core message:** If you have a YubiKey, you already have better security hardware than most laptops ship with. yubios shows you how to use it for the full chain: proving your OS hasn't been tampered with, unlocking your encrypted drive, logging into apps, and keeping your SSH keys off-disk entirely. No proprietary TPM chips. No trusting your OEM. Just your YubiKey and open-source code.

**Supporting points:**
- Works on mainstream hardware (including Microsoft Surface)
- Step-by-step onboarding — you don't need to know what FIDO2 is to start
- Your keys never leave the YubiKey hardware
- Open source, auditable, community-maintained

## Asset Templates

### HN "Show HN" Post

```
Show HN: yubios – bootable Linux with YubiKey as the sole root of trust (no TPM)

https://github.com/corning-croak-cable/yubios

Most Linux security guides still treat TPM as the hardware anchor for disk encryption and 
Secure Boot — but TPM is OEM-controlled, absent on a lot of ARM hardware, and a black box. 
YubiKeys are everywhere in enterprise already and support exactly what we need:

- Secure Boot key custody: PIV/CCID interface via sbsign --engine pkcs11
- Disk encryption: FIDO2 via systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto
- App auth: pam-u2f ≥1.3.1 (floor set due to CVE-2025-23013)
- SSH: resident ed25519-sk keys — private key never leaves the key

The design borrows from bootc (OCI image-based, declarative kargs.d) and ParticleOS 
(immutable root, clean boot-time security model). Every non-obvious decision has a source 
citation or ADR in the repo.

Happy to answer questions about the FIDO2/PIV boundary or the ARM64 Surface support.
```

### r/netsec Post

```
Title: yubios: TPM-free Linux using YubiKey for boot signing, disk encryption, PAM, and SSH

Full write-up: https://github.com/corning-croak-cable/yubios

Built this as an alternative to TPM-based disk encryption for hardware where the TPM is 
either absent (Snapdragon ARM64), vendor-locked, or not trusted (corporate MDM scenarios).

The security chain:
1. Secure Boot — YubiKey PIV slot 9c signs the UKI via sbsign --engine pkcs11
2. LUKS2 unlock — systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto binds the disk to the YubiKey's 
   FIDO2 credential (not a PIN, not a passphrase)
3. PAM auth — pam-u2f ≥1.3.1 handles sudo/polkit (version floor: CVE-2025-23013)
4. SSH — resident ed25519-sk keys, onboarding script walks through enrollment

Also documents the FIDO2/hidraw vs PIV/CCID distinction — Secure Boot signing goes through 
the CCID interface because the toolchain (sbsign) doesn't speak HID. ADR-002 covers why.

Questions welcome on the threat model or the ARM64 Surface hardware support.
```

### r/privacy Post

```
Title: I built a Linux distro where your YubiKey controls everything — boot, encryption, login, SSH

https://github.com/corning-croak-cable/yubios

If you have a YubiKey (even the basic Security Key), you have better hardware security than 
most laptops trust. Most operating systems ignore it except for 2FA. yubios uses it for everything:

🔐 Proves your OS hasn't been tampered with before it boots
💾 Unlocks your encrypted drive (your key is the only key — no passphrase backup that can leak)
🔑 Logs you into apps and sudo without a password
🔒 Keeps your SSH private key inside the YubiKey hardware, never on disk

No TPM chip required. Works on regular hardware. Open source and auditable.

The onboarding guide walks through it from scratch — you don't need to already understand FIDO2.
```

### Press Pitch (Phoronix / LWN / Ars)

```
Subject: yubios: open-source bootable Linux using YubiKey as full hardware root of trust

Hi [name],

Quick tip — might interest your readers:

yubios is a new open-source project that replaces TPM-based security in a bootable Linux 
image with the YubiKey, covering the full chain: Secure Boot key signing (PIV/CCID), 
LUKS2 disk unlock (FIDO2 via systemd-cryptenroll), PAM authentication (pam-u2f), and 
resident SSH keys (ed25519-sk). No OEM trust anchor required.

It's relevant now because ARM64 hardware (Surface Snapdragon Elite X, etc.) often lacks 
a usable TPM, and enterprise YubiKey deployments are ubiquitous — but most distributions 
still treat these as 2FA-only devices. yubios demonstrates the full integration.

GitHub: https://github.com/corning-croak-cable/yubios

Happy to answer technical questions or provide a briefing. The repo includes architecture 
decision records for every non-obvious security choice.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't cross-post to 5 subreddits at once.** Stagger by 30-60 minutes. Mods notice.
- **Don't lead with features.** Lead with the problem (TPM lock-in, OEM opacity) then show the solution.
- **Don't write for everyone.** The technical post assumes they know what FIDO2 is. The general post doesn't. Same project, different story.
- **Don't disappear after posting.** The first 2-4 hours of comments are where launches live or die.
- **Don't use "revolutionary," "game-changing," "novel."** Signals insecurity. Let the tech speak.
- **Don't pitch press before seeding community.** If HN picks it up first, Phoronix might cover it unprompted. Work with that.
